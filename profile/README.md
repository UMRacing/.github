### What is UM Racing?

UM Racing is Maltaâ€™s only Formula Student team. The team, designs, funds, and builds Formula style race cars which are raced against other universities from all around the world.

Our aims are simple, build something special, have fun doing so and gather skills worth applying in both working and private lives. In fact, UM Racing provides its members a work-like environment which provides solid experiences that are transferable to the real world.

UM Racing is a student based Voluntary Organization that is made up of around 25 hard working members that come from different faculties within the University of Malta.

UM Racing has competed internationally seven times with four different race cars. With every competition giving us an opportunity to improve the team, a tradition that we aim to continue building upon.

Since the competition judges both car performance and pre-event planning, our skills are well and truly tested. Therefore, because this project gives rise to various challenges, we recognized the importance of reaching out to experts to help us realize our dream and strive for better quality and performance.
